# dream — Agent Skill

A **dream** reads the memory store (the Obsidian vault) alongside the recent
session transcripts, and produces a *reorganized* version of the store:
duplicates merged, stale entries archived, contradictions replaced with the
latest value, new insights folded in, `MEMORY.md` trimmed. This mirrors
Anthropic's managed-agents "dreams": **the live vault is never modified in
place** — the dream works on a git branch you review, then merge (adopt) or
delete (discard).

Mental model: a **defragmenter**. It clears out old/duplicate cruft so the
store stays fast for Claude to consume.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve context, mode, and guards

1. **Vault + config.** The vault is in the session-start context ("Second brain
   vault: …"). Call it `<vault>`. The scheduled run starts *in* the vault.
2. **Parse args:** `--quick` (fast mode), `--notify` (send Slack DM — the weekly
   scheduled run passes this; on-demand `/dream` must NOT), `--slack-dm <ID>`
   (where to send it), `--worktree "<path>"` and `--week <YYYY-Wxx>` (the
   scheduled run's ready-made worktree and its period label),
   `--since YYYY-MM-DD` (override the window).
   - **Scheduled run** (`--worktree` given): the runner has already committed
     the vault's pending changes and created the branch `dream/<week>` in a
     new worktree at that path. Everything you need is in the args. Don't
     read `~/.claude/second-brain/config.env`; it is outside the folders this
     run may read. It runs unattended, so never stop to ask.
   - **On-demand run:** read `~/.claude/second-brain/config.env` for
     `SECOND_BRAIN_DREAM_DIR` (default `~/.claude/second-brain/dream-worktrees`)
     and `SECOND_BRAIN_TIMEZONE`. Call the worktree folder `<dream-dir>`.
3. **Work from inside the vault**, then from inside the worktree. Run plain
   `git <subcommand>` from the right folder: no `git -C`, no compound
   `&&` chains. The scheduled run only allows these git subcommands:
   `rev-parse`, `status`, `for-each-ref`, `log`, `diff`, `show`,
   `worktree list`, `add`, `commit`, `rm` (never with `--output`). Use the Read,
   Write and Edit tools for files, `date` for dates, and the read-only
   helper `python3 -I ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/journal-helper.py` for
   everything else: `list --glob "<pattern>"` to list files, `search --root
   <dir> --pattern <regex>` to search contents, and `sessions` (Step 2). Use
   the helper even if Glob or Grep tools exist, so runs behave the same on
   every Claude Code version. Nothing else (no `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `find`,
   `python3 -c`).
4. **Guards (on-demand runs only** — the scheduled runner has already done
   all three, so go straight to Step 1). Bail with a clear message if any
   fail (from inside `<vault>`):
   - Vault must be a git repo: `git rev-parse --git-dir` succeeds. If not:
     *"Vault isn't git-backed yet — run `git init` in `<vault>` first. Dreams need git for the non-destructive review branch."* Stop.
   - Working tree should be clean-ish on `main`: `git status --porcelain`.
     If there are uncommitted changes, commit them first so the dream branch
     diffs cleanly: `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "pre-dream snapshot"`.
     Tell the user you did this.
   - No existing dream branch for this period: `git for-each-ref refs/heads/dream/`
     (see Step 1 for the label). If one exists, ask whether to resume it or
     start fresh.

## Step 1 — Set up the dream worktree (non-destructive)

The dream works in an **isolated git worktree** so Obsidian (which follows
the live vault on `main`) is never disturbed while it runs.

**Scheduled run:** the worktree already exists. `$DREAM` is the `--worktree`
path, the period label is `--week`, and the branch `dream/<week>` is checked
out there. Don't run `git worktree add`; the run doesn't allow it.

**On-demand run:** compute the period label from the window end date: ISO
week `YYYY-Wxx` (`date +%G-W%V`). Then create the worktree inside
`<dream-dir>`. From inside `<vault>`, with absolute paths:

```bash
git worktree add "<dream-dir>/<vault-folder-name>-<YYYY-Wxx>" -b dream/<YYYY-Wxx>
```

(`<vault-folder-name>` is the last part of the vault path. `git worktree add`
creates `<dream-dir>` if it's missing.)

All reads-of-the-store for *editing* and **all writes** happen inside that
worktree (call it `$DREAM`, an absolute path). `cd "$DREAM"` once, and run
every later git command from there. Never edit files under the live
`<vault>` path during a dream.

## Step 2 — Gather inputs (the two dream input types)

- **The memory store** (read from `$DREAM`): `Memory/MEMORY.md`, `Topics/`,
  `People/`, `DataContext/`. This is what gets reorganized.
- **The sessions** (read-only, NEVER rewritten — the evidence the dream mines):
  - This window's Claude Code and Claude desktop sessions, summarized by the
    plugin's read-only helper (in a scheduled run use exactly this form, with
    the absolute path, so it matches the allow rule):
    `python3 -I ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/journal-helper.py sessions --since <start> --until <end> --max-chars 60000`.
    Open a specific transcript under `~/.claude/projects/` with Read only if
    a summary isn't enough.
  - This window's `Sessions/` handoffs (written by `/document --auto`).
  - This window's `Journal/` daily entries and `Meetings/` notes.
  Window = `--since` if given, else since the last dream (most recent
  `dream/*` merge or `Journal/*-rollup.md`), else the current ISO week.

`Journal/` and `Meetings/` are the immutable episodic record — read them for
evidence and timestamps, do not edit or delete them.

## Step 3 — Consolidation pass (the core)

Operate only on the **semantic memory**: `Topics/`, `People/`, `DataContext/`,
and `Memory/`. Apply the locked prune policy:

- **Dedup / merge.** Find notes covering the same person/topic/datum (near-dup
  filenames, heavy backlink overlap, restated content). Merge into the single
  best canonical note; fix inbound `[[wikilinks]]` to point at it;
  **hard-delete** the redundant copy (its content survives in the merge target
  and in git history).
- **Promote the inbox.** For each flat note the harness dropped in `Memory/`
  (anything other than `MEMORY.md`): route its durable content into the right
  graph note (`People/Topics/DataContext`) per the `MEMORY.md` routing table,
  cross-link it, then delete the inbox file. Drop one-off/episodic scraps into
  the relevant `Journal/` day as a `## Learned:` note instead.
- **Resolve contradictions.** When two notes disagree, keep the **latest** value
  (use Journal timestamps / git dates as tiebreaker). Replace the stale value in
  place and add a one-line `> superseded YYYY-MM-DD: was <old>` note.
- **Archive stale.** Whole notes that are clearly outdated (superseded
  workstream, departed person, retired model) **move to `_archive/`** (preserves
  recoverability, drops them out of the Tier-2 backlink grep). Don't hard-delete
  whole notes — archive them. Honor existing `_archive/` subfolders.
- **Surface insights.** Fold recurring patterns from the window's sessions into
  the graph: create/enrich Topic nodes and People files for things mentioned
  repeatedly but thinly grounded.
- **Trim `MEMORY.md`.** Push any detail that crept into the manifest down into
  the graph; keep it a thin mount-description (identity + routing table + pointer
  to `Topic-Index.md` + a few durable hot facts). Target well under the 25KB /
  200-line auto-load limit.
- **Regenerate `Topics/Topic-Index.md`** by scanning `Topics/`, `People/`,
  `DataContext/` (the recall entry point — keeping it current saves tokens in
  every daytime session).

**Moving and deleting notes** (there is no `mv` or `rm`): to archive a
note, Write its content to the `_archive/` path, then `git rm "<old path>"`.
To delete a merged duplicate, `git rm "<path>"`.

Commit the consolidation to the branch, from inside `$DREAM`, as two
commands: `git add -A`, then
`git commit -m "dream <YYYY-Wxx>: consolidate memory store"`.

## Step 4 — Weekly rollup (full mode only; skip in --quick)

Write the episodic digest `Journal/<YYYY-Wxx>-rollup.md`, following
`<vault>/DataContext/Weekly-Rollup-Template.md` if it exists. Include: week's theme, key
deliverables by topic, decisions, blockers, people, topic-node updates,
`## Open Questions for the user` (recurring gaps — capped at 10), `## Questions
Resolved This Week` (if `DataContext/kickoff-resolutions.md` exists, scan it for
`→ Written to` this week), and staleness escalations (questions appearing 3+
consecutive days).
This is an append (new file) — the rollup never rewrites prior journals.
Commit it.

## Step 5 — Dream Report (always)

Write `$DREAM/Dream-Report.md` AND print it to the terminal. Open with a
**fragmentation summary**, then details:

```markdown
# Dream Report — <YYYY-Wxx>

## Defrag summary
- Duplicate clusters merged: N   (files deleted: M)
- Notes archived (stale):    N
- Contradictions resolved:   N
- Inbox notes promoted:      N
- Insights surfaced (new/enriched Topics & People): N
- MEMORY.md: <before>KB → <after>KB
- Orphan notes linked:       N

## Merges
- `People/Jon Doe (1).md` → merged into `People/Jon Doe.md` (deleted dup)
## Archived
- `Topics/Old Thing.md` → `_archive/` — superseded by [[New Thing]]
## Contradictions
- `DataContext/x.md`: PEPM floor $5 → $6 (latest, per 2026-05-20 journal)
## Insights
- New `Topics/<X>.md` — mentioned in 4 sessions, was ungrounded

## Review
- Diff:    git -C "<vault>" diff main..dream/<YYYY-Wxx>
- Adopt:   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/adopt-dream.sh <YYYY-Wxx>
- Discard: bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/adopt-dream.sh <YYYY-Wxx> --discard
```

Write the real absolute paths into the Review block (the vault path, and
the plugin's script path as it appears in this skill), so the commands work
from any folder. These are for the user to run later; don't run them.

## Step 6 — Notify (ONLY if --notify)

If and only if `--notify` was passed (weekly scheduled run), send the Defrag
summary + Review block as a Slack DM to the `--slack-dm` ID (on demand,
`SECOND_BRAIN_SLACK_DM` from config.env) via the Slack connector. If it isn't set or no Slack tool is available, say so and skip. On
on-demand `/dream`, send nothing to Slack — the terminal + `Dream-Report.md`
are the whole output.

## Step 7 — Hand off (do NOT merge)

Leave the branch + worktree for review. Print the Review block. The dream never
merges itself — adoption is the user's explicit `adopt-dream.sh` (or merge),
discard is `adopt-dream.sh <YYYY-Wxx> --discard`.

---

## --quick mode

Skip Steps 2's session-mining, Step 4 (rollup), and Step 5's insight surfacing.
Do only: trim `MEMORY.md` under limit, promote the `Memory/` inbox, merge
obvious duplicates, regenerate `Topic-Index.md`. Still runs on the worktree/branch
and still writes a (shorter) Dream Report. For when the manifest is bloating and
the user wants a fast defrag.

## Rules / safety

- **Never edit the live vault working tree during a dream** — only the worktree.
- **Never rewrite `Journal/` or `Meetings/`** — episodic record is read-only.
- **Archive whole notes, hard-delete only merged duplicates** (locked prune policy).
- **Never merge the branch yourself.** Adoption and discard are the user's.
- **Be concrete and conservative:** if unsure whether two notes are truly
  duplicates or whether a note is stale, leave it and note it in the report under
  a `## Needs the user's call` section rather than acting.
- Don't fabricate. Surface gaps as Open Questions; don't invent content.
